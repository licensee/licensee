## The problem

* You've got an open source project. How do you know what you can and can't do with the software?
* You've got a bunch of open source projects, how do you know what their licenses are?
* You've got a project with a license file, but which license is it? Has it been modified?

## The solution

Licensee automates the process of reading `LICENSE` files and compares their contents to known licenses using a several strategies (which we call "Matchers"). It attempts to determine a project's license in the following order:

* If the license file has an explicit copyright notice, and nothing more (e.g., `Copyright (c) 2015 Ben Balter`), we'll assume the author intends to retain all rights, and thus the project isn't licensed.
* If the license is an exact match to a known license. If we strip away whitespace and copyright notice, we might get lucky, and direct string comparison in Ruby is cheap.
* If we still can't match the license, we use a fancy math thing called the [Sørensen–Dice coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient), which is really good at calculating the similarity between two strings. By calculating the percent changed from the known license to the license file, you can tell, e.g., that a given license is 95% similar to the MIT license, that 5% likely representing legally insignificant changes to the license text.

## Installation

To use the latest released [gem](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) from [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/):

    gem install licensee

To use licensee programmatically in your own Ruby project, add `gem 'licensee'` to your project's `Gemfile`.

To run licensee directly from source:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install --path vendor/bundle
    bundle exec bin/licensee

On Windows, the last line needs to include the Ruby interpreter:

    bundle exec ruby bin\licensee

## Docker

Licensee also comes with a Dockerfile if you prefer to run Licensee within a Docker container:

1. `git clone https://github.com/licensee/licensee && cd licensee`
2. `docker build . --tag licensee`
3. `docker run licensee [COMMAND]` (see [command line usage](./command-line-usage.md))

*Example (detecting the license of `rails/rails` on GitHub):* `docker run licensee detect rails/rails --remote`

## Semantic Versioning

This project conforms to [semver](http://semver.org/). As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint](http://guides.rubygems.org/patterns/) with two digits of precision. For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency 'licensee', '~> 1.0'
```

This means your project is compatible with licensee 1.0 up until 2.0. You can also set a higher minimum version:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency 'licensee', '~> 1.1'
```
