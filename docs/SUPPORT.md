Licensee is an open source project used by hosted services like GitHub and GitLab which often  detect licenses using prior versions of Licensee and cache the result.

If you'd like to report that a license is improperly detected by a hosted service, please contact [GitHub support](https://github.com/contact) or [GitLab support](https://about.gitlab.com/getting-help/) directly.
