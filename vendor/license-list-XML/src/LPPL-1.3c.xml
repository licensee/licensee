      <p>PREAMBLE
        <br/>========
      </p>
      <p>The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under which the LaTeX kernel and the base
         LaTeX packages are distributed.</p>
      <p>You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute.
         This license may be particularly suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but
         it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to TeX.</p>
      <p>The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE', below, gives instructions,
         examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this
         license.</p>
      <p>This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions
         under which modified versions of that work may be distributed.</p>
      <p>We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute
         modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
         maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work. If you do not see how to
         achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex' and
         `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.</p>
      <p>DEFINITIONS
        <br/>===========
      </p>
      <p>In this license document the following terms are used:</p>
      <p>`Work' Any work being distributed under this License. `Derived Work' Any work that under any
         applicable law is derived from the Work.</p>
      <p>`Modification' Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law -- for example,
         the production of a file containing an original file associated with the Work or a significant portion
         of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</p>
      <p>`Modify' To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable law.
         `Distribution' Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in whole or in
         part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to) making any electronic components of the Work
         accessible by file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems such as Sun's
         Network File System (NFS).</p>
      <p>`Compiled Work' A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it is directly
         usable on a computer system. This processing may include using installation facilities provided by the
         Work, transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other activities. Note that
         modification of any installation facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the
         Work.</p>
      <p>`Current Maintainer' A person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is no such
         explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under any applicable law.</p>
      <p>`Base Interpreter' A program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part
         or the whole of the Work.</p>
      <p>A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the Base
         Interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
         interactively. Unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only applicable
         Base Interpreter is a `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the `LaTeX-format'
         a program implementing the `TeX language'.</p>
      <p>CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
        <br/>===========================================
      </p>
      <list>
        <item>
            <bullet>1.</bullet>
          Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work are not covered by this
             license; they are outside its scope. In particular, the act of running the Work is not
             restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>2.</bullet>
          You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you received it. Distribution of
             only part of the Work is considered modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such
             a Derived Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>3.</bullet>
          You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of
             the Work as distributed under Clause 2 above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in
             such a way that the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly as it
             would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work directly from the Work.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>4.</bullet>
          If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without restriction, modify the Work,
             thus creating a Derived Work. You may also distribute the Derived Work without restriction,
             including Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works distributed in this
             manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the Work.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>5.</bullet>
          If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify your copy of the Work, thus
             creating a Derived Work based on the Work, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a
             Compiled Work based on the Derived Work.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>6.</bullet>
          If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Derived Work provided the
             following conditions are met for every component of the Work unless that component clearly
             states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only the Current
             Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the Work.
        <list>
               <item>
                  <bullet>a.</bullet>
            If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement for a component of the Work
               when that component is used with the Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of
               the Work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that Base Interpreter,
               the replacement component of this Derived Work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself
               as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that Base
               Interpreter.
          </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>b.</bullet>
            Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the
               changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as
               part of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes.
          </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>c.</bullet>
            No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons, including (but not limited to)
               the authors of the original version of the Work, provide any support, including (but not
               limited to) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived Work unless
               those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the Derived
               Work.
          </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>d.</bullet>
            You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
          <list>
                     <item>
                        <bullet>1.</bullet>
              A complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution of a modified component is
                 made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then
                 offering equivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar place meets
                 this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the Work along
                 with the modified component;
            </item>
                     <item>
                        <bullet>2.</bullet>
              Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the Work.
            </item>
                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>7.</bullet>
          If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may distribute a Compiled Work generated
             from a Derived Work, as long as the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the
             Compiled Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with regard to the
             Derived Work.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>8.</bullet>
          The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification,
             by any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that
             component of the Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4,
             above.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>9.</bullet>
          Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative format, where the Work or that
             Derived Work (in whole or in part) is then produced by applying some process to that format,
             does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of
             applying that process.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>10.</bullet>

               <item>
                  <bullet>a.</bullet>
            A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself
               honors the conditions listed in Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not
               have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.
          </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>b.</bullet>
            If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that Derived Work must provide
               sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to
               honor the restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.
          </item>
            </list>
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>11.</bullet>
          This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the Work, nor does this
             license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the Work by any means.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>12.</bullet>
          Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all
             parties with all applicable laws.
        </item>
        </list>
      <p>NO WARRANTY
        <br/>===========
      </p>
      <p>There is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in writing, the Copyright Holder
         provides the Work `as is', without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
         including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
         particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with you.
         Should the Work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or
         correction.</p>
      <p>In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will The Copyright Holder,
         or any author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who may distribute
         and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any
         general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or
         out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being
         rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to
         operate with any other programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other
         party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
      <p>MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
        <br/>=======================
      </p>
      <p>The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder explicitly and
         prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the Work that the Work can only be
         maintained by the Copyright Holder or simply that it is `author-maintained'.</p>
      <p>The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer who has indicated in
         the Work that they are willing to receive error reports for the Work (for example, by
         supplying a valid e-mail address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to
         acknowledge or act upon these error reports.</p>
      <p>The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there is no Current
         Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current Maintainer of the work cannot be reached
         through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months, and there are no
         other significant signs of active maintenance.</p>
      <p>You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with any existing Current
         Maintainer to take over this role.</p>
      <p>If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of the Work through the
         following steps:</p>
      <list>
        <item>
            <bullet>1.</bullet>
          Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the Copyright Holder, if the two
             differ) through the means of an Internet or similar search.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>2.</bullet>
          If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is still maintained.
        <list>
               <item>
                  <bullet>a.</bullet>
            If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to update their communication data
               within one month.
          </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>b.</bullet>
            If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the
               Current Maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take
               over maintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for example, by
               posting to comp.text.tex.)
          </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>3a.</bullet>
            If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the Work to you,
               then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.
          </item>
               <item>
                  <bullet>b.</bullet>
          If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright Holder agrees that maintenance of
             the Work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.
          </item>
            </list>
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>4.</bullet>
          If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above and after three months
             your intention is challenged neither by the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor
             by other people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as the
             (new) Current Maintainer.
        </item>
        <item>
            <bullet>5.</bullet>
          If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months
             of a change completed under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become
             or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication
             data within one month.
        </item>
      </list>
      <p>A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the Work is distributed under
         the LPPL license.</p>
      <p>If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should immediately provide, within the Work, a
         prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also announce
         your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b) above.</p>
      <p>WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
        <br/>======================================================
      </p>
      <p>This section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are
         considering distributing their works under this license. These authors are addressed as `you' in
         this section.</p>
      <p>Choosing This License or Another License
        <br/>----------------------------------------
      </p>
      <p>If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution* conditions that differ significantly
         from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,
         distribute your work under a different license. You may use the text of this license as a model for
         your own license, but your license should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that
         your work is distributed under the LPPL.</p>
      <p>The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains the motivation behind the
         conditions of this license. It explains, for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General
         Public License (GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to LaTeX, the
         discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their
         works under any license are encouraged to read it.</p>
      <p>A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
        <br/>-----------------------------------------------------
      </p>
      <p>It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting
         the above conditions for distributing the modified component. While you might intend that such
         modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident -- you may forget that you
         have modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
         version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that
         could have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in
         your best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public one. Many works provide
         ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components.</p>
      <p>How to Use This License
        <br/>-----------------------
      </p>
      <p>To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice
         including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include
         also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the
         conditions in this license.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of such a notice and statement:</p>
      <standardLicenseHeader>
      <p><optional>%%</optional> <alt name="filename" match=".+">pig.dtx</alt>
        <br/><optional>%%</optional> Copyright <alt name="copyright" match=".+">2005 M. Y. Name</alt>
        <br/><optional>%</optional>
        <br/><optional>%</optional> This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
        <br/><optional>%</optional> conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
        <br/><optional>%</optional> of this license or (at your option) any later version.
        <br/><optional>%</optional> The latest version of this license is in
        <br/><optional>%</optional> http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
        <br/><optional>%</optional> and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
        <br/><optional>%</optional> version 2005/12/01 or later.
        <br/><optional>%</optional>
        <br/><optional>%</optional> This work has the LPPL maintenance status "<alt name="status" match="author-maintained|unmaintained|maintained">maintained</alt>".
        <br/><optional>%</optional>
        <br/><optional>%</optional> The Current Maintainer of this work is <alt name="maintainer" match=".+">M. Y. Name</alt>.
        <br/><optional>%</optional>
        <br/><optional>%</optional> This work consists of the <alt name="filenames" match=".+">files pig.dtx and pig.ins
        <br/>% and the derived file pig.sty</alt>.
      </p>
      </standardLicenseHeader>
      <p>Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply,
         with the `Work' referring to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty'
         (the last being generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'
         referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and `Current Maintainer'
         referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.</p>
      <p>If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your Work, change `maintained' above
         into `author-maintained'. However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the
         Maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the community even
         when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself.</p>
      <p>Derived Works That Are Not Replacements
        <br/>---------------------------------------
      </p>
      <p>Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community.
         They therefore concern themselves with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a
         (compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If this is not the case (e.g., if a few
         lines of code are reused for a completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.</p>
      <p>Important Recommendations
        <br/>-------------------------
      </p>
      <p>Defining What Constitutes the Work</p>
      <p>The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files of the Work. It is therefore
         important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This
         could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work near the copyright
         notice of each file or by using a line such as:</p>
      <p>% This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.</p>
      <p>in that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine
         what is considered by you to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to
         make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work.</p>
