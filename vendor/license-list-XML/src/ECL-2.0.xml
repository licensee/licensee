          Grant of Copyright License.
          <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
             perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
             reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and

          Grant of Patent License.
          <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a
             perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
             this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
             otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
             by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by
             combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
             submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
             counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the
             Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
             to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
             filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to contributions by an individual
             employed by an institution or organization is limited to patent claims where the individual
             that is the author of the Work is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where
             the organization or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and
             research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.</p>

          Redistribution.
          <p>You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium,
             with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the
             following conditions:</p>

               <item>
                  <bullet>a.</bullet>

            If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
               Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
               notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
               any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
               text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
               by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
               contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
               License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
               distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
               such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
            <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
               different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
               modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

             the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
             without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

             warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

             otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts)
             or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
             direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
             result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not
             limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
             any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of

      <p>While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
         acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
         with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on
         Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
         such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
