      <notes>This license was released 26 February 2007. The identifier OFL-1.1 can be used to indicate that
             version 1.1 of the SIL Open Font License applies, without asserting whether or not a Reserved
             Font Name is used. See OFL-1.1-RFN and OFL-1.1-no-RFN for alternative identifiers that can be
             used to express explicitly that a Reserved Font Name is used or is not used, respectively.</notes>

         <p>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE</p>
         <p>Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>
      </titleText>

      <p>PREAMBLE</p>
      <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font
         projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide
         a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.</p>
      <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they
         are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
         redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
         derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of
         license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created
         using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
