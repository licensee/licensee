terms of your choice, provided that you also comply with the requirements of
this license for the covered software. if the larger work is a combination of
covered software with a work governed by one or more secondary licenses, and the

warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by you alone,
and you hereby agree to indemnify every contributor for any liability incurred
by such contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
terms you offer. you may include additional disclaimers of warranty and
limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. 4. inability to comply
due to statute or regulation if it is impossible for you to comply with any of

be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
understand it. 5. termination 5.1. the rights granted under this license will
terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms. however, if
you become compliant, then the rights granted under this license from a
particular contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
contributor explicitly and finally terminates your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
basis, if such contributor fails to notify you of the non-compliance by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after you have come back into compliance.
moreover, your grants from a particular contributor are reinstated on an ongoing
basis if such contributor notifies you of the non-compliance by some reasonable
means, this is the first time you have received notice of non-compliance with
this license from such contributor, and you become compliant prior to 30 days
after your receipt of the notice. 5.2. if you initiate litigation against any
entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment
actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a contributor version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to you by
any and all contributors for the covered software under section 2.1 of this
license shall terminate. 5.3. in the event of termination under sections 5.1 or
5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and
resellers) which have been validly granted by you or your distributors under
this license prior to termination shall survive termination. 6. disclaimer of
warranty covered software is provided under this license on an "as is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the covered software is free of
defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. the
entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered software is with
you. should any covered software prove defective in any respect, you (not any
contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
this disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license. no
use of any covered software is authorized under this license except under this
disclaimer. 7. limitation of liability under no circumstances and under no legal
theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
contributor, or anyone who distributes covered software as permitted above, be
liable to you for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost
profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have
been informed of the possibility of such damages. this limitation of liability
shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such
party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you. 8.
litigation any litigation relating to this license may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,
without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. nothing in this section
shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims. 9.
miscellaneous this license represents the complete agreement concerning the
subject matter hereof. if any provision of this license is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable. any law or regulation which provides that the language of a

this license against a contributor. 10. versions of the license 10.1. new
